diplomska:
- bugs:
	- z indicator ni prou
	- pointclouds se ne prilagajajo razdalji

	- geometries aren't removed from geometrylayer when layer is removed sometimes
	- add select interaction for mass deleting

- backend:
	- hosts files for pointclouds and .gltf models -> convert some ifcs to gltf so you have usable models, add more pointclouds
	- allows people to edit geometries in realtime via websockets -> UPDATE THIS LATER, should use uuid-d sessions, create a list of "projects" each project is also a session or smth
